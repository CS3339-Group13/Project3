Cycle 1:
    - Try to get inst 0, 1 from cache -> miss -> nothing happens
    - Cache requests inst 0, 1 from memory
Cycle 2:
    - Try to get inst 0, 1 from cache -> hit -> inst 0, 1 in Pre-Issue
Cycle 3:
    - Inst 0, 1 dequeues from Pre-Issue, goes through Issue Unit, enqueues into Pre-ALU
    - Try to get inst 2, 3 from cache -> miss -> nothing happens
    - Cache requests inst 2, 3 from memory
Cycle 4:
    - Inst 0 dequeues from Pre-ALU, goes through ALU, enqueues into Post-ALU
    - Try to get inst 2, 3 from cache -> hit -> inst 2, 3 in Pre-Issue
Cycle 5:
    - Inst 0 dequeues from Post-ALU, goes through WB Unit, result written to register file
    - Inst 1 dequeues from Pre-ALU, goes through ALU, enqueues into Post-ALU
